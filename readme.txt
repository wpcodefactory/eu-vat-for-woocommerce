**Unlock Seamless B2B Transactions with the UK/EU VAT Manager**

In the rapidly evolving eCommerce landscape, the ability to cater to both B2C and B2B customers has become essential for growth and scalability.

For store owners selling across the UK and EU, navigating the complexities of Value Added Tax (VAT) can be challenging.

B2B transactions within this region often need validation of VAT numbers to ensure legitimate business purchases, allowing sellers to exempt these buyers from VAT charges, where they report it to their local tax authorities.

With our **EU/UK VAT Validation Manager for WooCommerce** plugin, you can effortlessly validate UK/EU VAT numbers using [VIES (VAT Information Exchange System) services](https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/vies/#/vat-validation "VIES (VAT Information Exchange System) services"), enabling you to sell to businesses in the EU without the additional tax burden.

This not only streamlines your checkout process but ensures compliance, boosting trust and confidence among your B2B clientele.

In a nutshell, here is what this plugin does:

* **Collect & Validate VAT numbers:** Adds EU VAT field to checkout page to collect VAT numbers and validate in real time

* **Collect VAT on Signup:** Add the EU VAT field to your WooCommerce signup form, entries will be automatically saved in customer data fields

* **Preserve (keep) or Exempt VAT:** Based on tax laws, select to remove VAT for valid VAT numbers or keep it, per country

* **Custom Progress Messages:** Customize & show messages during validation so customers are informed what's happening behind while communicating with VIES

* **Set Field Requirement:** Go beyond optional & required, the plugin allows you to make the field customization based on different cases (more details below)

* **Checkout Block-based Compatible:** The plugin works seamlessly with the new block-based Checkout page

* **Add VAT Number to PDF Invoices:** Compatibility with the renowned [PDF Invoice & Packing Slips](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-pdf-invoices-packing-slips/ "PDF Invoice & Packing Slips") plugin, or any other plugin manually using field_id `_billing_eu_vat_number`

**Important Note: Throughout this description, we use "EU VAT or VAT" to refer to both EU and UK VAT for simplicity and flow. All options and rules specified for the EU also apply to the UK.**

> ‚ÄúBest plugin for EU VAT: I was using another plugin that is not supported anymore. Then I found EU/UK VAT Manager for WooCommerce, and really, I‚Äôm very happy the other plugin is not supported anymore, not because it was not a good plugin, on the contrary, it was. But in another case probably I didn‚Äôt find this amazing plugin, that is even a lot better. EU/UK VAT Manager for WooCommerce is the best plugin to manage the EU VAT. I love the VAT check that is made via Ajax in the background when you are in the checkout. Really kudos for this amazing plugin!‚Äù ‚Äì ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê [Jose](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/best-plugin-for-eu-vat/)

> ‚ÄúPerfect PLUGIN & Service: I was looking for a plugin for a european based b2b shop which will deduct the VAT from other eu countries. Found this plugin, installed it and it worked perfectly! The VAT was deducted on point and i was very happy. But then i noticed that orders from the same country will also deduct the VAT which I thought was not possible. I contacted Omar and he replied that this new feature will be released soon. Today he messaged me to update the plugin and i did! And guess what, now it works exactly as i needed it! Thanks a lot for this plugin and service!‚Äù ‚Äì ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê [khang1985](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/perfect-plugin-service-2/)
